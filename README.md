    <h1>Sew Tomato Site</h1>

### About/Goals
Create a site about the Company with frameworks that are good with longevity and security. However, frameworks are not really necessary unless something complex needs to be made.

According to my knowledge, this should be a simple site about the Seamstress behind the company and a link to their Etsy so people can purchase their goods/services as necessary.

Currently, there is no set date of release.
